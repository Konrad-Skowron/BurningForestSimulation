# BurningForestSimulation

The program simulates the spread of a fire in a forest with the use of a two-dimensional mesh of any size. The simulation begins with a random mesh initialization. The `forestation` initialization parameter corresponds to the tree density.

**T** - tree  
**X** - no tree  
**B** - burned tree
